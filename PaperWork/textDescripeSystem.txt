Introduction:

The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of a software application designed for the registration and management of students and their supervisors. The software allows for the registration of new users by admins and provides functionality for managing user accounts, scheduling meetings, and generating reports.

This report will provide an overview of the software features, discuss the software architecture and design, and evaluate the software based on its functionality, usability, and security.

Software Overview:

The software is a web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC and C# programming language. It uses Entity Framework as a database package to access the SQL Server database. The software allows admins to register new users, including students and supervisors. Each user is assigned a role (student, supervisor, or admin) and is provided with a unique login ID and password.

The software allows each user to manage their account by updating their profile picture, changing their password, and updating their information, including their free time. Each user can specify their free time by indicating the free day (between 1 and 7) and free hours (between 1 and 24) on that day.

Supervisors can create meetings with their students, based on the free time of both the supervisor and student. Each meeting has a start hour and end hour (between 1 and 24) and can include meeting tasks as text. When the meeting time comes, the supervisor can mark the student present and check for completed tasks.

Reports are available to view student activities, such as completed and uncompleted tasks, as well as meeting attendance.

Software Architecture and Design:

The software architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model component defines the application data and business logic, the view component handles the user interface, and the controller component handles the user input and manages the flow of data between the model and view components.

The database schema consists of tables for users, meetings, and user roles. The users table contains information about each user, including their name, email address, role, phone number, password, and free time. The meetings table contains information about each meeting, including the start and end times, meeting tasks, and attendance status. The user roles table contains information about each user's role, including their permissions and access level.

The software design includes several security features, including password hashing, role-based access control, and session management. Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, and only authorized users can access the application features based on their assigned role. Sessions are managed to ensure that users are logged out automatically after a certain period of inactivity, preventing unauthorized access to the application.

Evaluation:

Functionality:
The software provides essential functionality for the registration and management of students and their supervisors. The registration process is straightforward and allows admins to create new users with specific roles and access levels. The software allows users to manage their accounts, including updating their profile picture, changing their password, and specifying their free time. Supervisors can create meetings with their students, and reports are available to view student activities.

Usability:
The software provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Users can access their account information and update their details quickly. The meeting scheduling process is simple and intuitive, and the reports are easy to read and provide valuable information about student activities.

Security:
The software includes several security features, such as password hashing, role-based access control, and session management. Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, which helps to protect against password-related attacks. Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can access the application features based on their assigned role. Session management helps to prevent unauthorized

4.3 Meeting Management
One of the key features of the Student-Supervisor Registration System is the ability for supervisors to create meetings with their assigned students. Meetings are an essential tool for supervisors to keep track of their students' progress and provide guidance as needed. The system allows supervisors to schedule meetings by specifying the start and end times and tasks to be discussed during the meeting.

When the scheduled meeting time arrives, the system will send a notification to both the supervisor and the student. The notification will contain the meeting details, including the tasks to be discussed during the meeting. During the meeting, the supervisor can mark the student as present and track the completion of tasks.

The system also includes a feature for students and supervisors to view a report of their meeting history. The report includes details such as the date and time of the meeting, the tasks discussed, and whether the tasks were completed.

4.4 Free Time Management
To facilitate efficient meeting scheduling, the system allows each user to specify their free time. Users can specify their free time as a free day of the week (e.g., Saturday) and a range of free hours during that day (e.g., 2 PM to 5 PM). This information is stored in the system and used to suggest meeting times that are convenient for both the supervisor and student.

4.5 Supervision Expiry and Renewal
Each supervision has an expiry date. When the expiry date is reached, the supervisor can no longer create new meetings, and the account becomes read-only. To continue supervising their assigned students, supervisors must renew their supervision by extending the expiry date. The system allows supervisors to extend their supervision for an additional six months, twice.

4.6 Warning System
The Student-Supervisor Registration System includes a warning system to alert supervisors and students when a student is not attending meetings regularly. If a student fails to attend meetings regularly, the system will send a warning to their email address, reminding them of the importance of attendance and encouraging them to attend future meetings.

Implementation Details
The Student-Supervisor Registration System was implemented using ASP.NET Core MVC, C# programming language, and Entity Framework for database access. The system uses a SQL Server database to store user information, meeting details, and other data.

The system was designed to be easy to use and user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive user interface. The interface was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a responsive and modern look and feel.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Student-Supervisor Registration System is a valuable tool for universities and academic institutions that need to manage student-supervisor relationships. The system provides a convenient way for administrators to register students and supervisors, and for supervisors to manage their assigned students and meetings.

The system includes features such as meeting management, free time management, supervision expiry and renewal, and a warning system to ensure that students are attending meetings regularly. The system was implemented using modern web technologies and is easy to use and user-friendly.

The Student-Supervisor Registration System has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of student-supervisor relationships, allowing academic institutions to provide better support for their students and ensure their success.

Future Work
While the current software system offers a comprehensive set of features for managing student supervision, there is always room for improvement and further development. In particular, the following areas could be explored in future work:

Integration with other systems: The current system is designed to be standalone, but it could be integrated with other systems to provide more comprehensive support for students and supervisors. For example, it could be integrated with a learning management system to provide additional resources and support for students.

Automated scheduling: While the current system allows supervisors and students to specify their free time, the scheduling of meetings is still largely a manual process. In future work, it may be possible to develop algorithms that can automatically schedule meetings based on the availability of supervisors and students.

Machine learning for performance evaluation: The current system includes features for tracking the attendance and completion of tasks by students, but it does not provide any feedback on the quality of supervision. In future work, machine learning algorithms could be developed to automatically evaluate the quality of supervision based on factors such as student performance, supervisor feedback, and student satisfaction surveys.

Mobile application: While the current system is designed as a web application, a mobile application could be developed to provide students and supervisors with greater flexibility and ease of use.

Data analytics: The current system stores a wealth of data on student supervision activities, which could be analyzed to identify patterns and trends. In future work, data analytics techniques could be applied to this data to identify areas where supervision could be improved, and to provide feedback to supervisors and students.

In conclusion, the current software system provides a solid foundation for managing student supervision, but there are many opportunities for future work to further improve and extend its capabilities. By continuing to develop and refine this system, we can ensure that students receive the highest quality supervision possible, and that they are well-equipped to succeed in their academic careers.
